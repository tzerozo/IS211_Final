#Book Catalouge Project

This project is a summary of what we've learned in the whole semester eventhough I omit some features such as PythonAnywhere.
The beginning of working on a project is always frustrating for me as I would worry that I will miss something or misunderstand requirements.
This project make you to go back and refresh yourself with topics such as flask, modules (urllib.request, session, flash, time, pickle, json, ....), and OOPs.
The only topics that I didn't revise are: Algorithms (BigO) and Design Patterns (MVC, factory, etc).
Phase1: I am lost, I am worried, I am writing down (how many functions, how many pages, how many routes, how many html files under templates)
Phase2: About at 20% of the project, the fun begins. All you've learn (urllib, sqlite3,...) are so useful that you felt like dancing.
Phase3: Around when 70% of the project is done, the headache began. Testing and errors are everywhere and had to do more research.
Phase4: Youtube & Google became a tutor, a guide, a friend. (worthy to mention: CS50:Flask, Tech with Tim: Flask)
Phase5: Fingers cross that all the code you type are error free and properly function.

Advice:Please revisit each topic in the class (by watching youtube video or reading a book) before starting on the project.
